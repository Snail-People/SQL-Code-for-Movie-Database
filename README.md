# This project was focused on a fictional movie rental company called rockbuster. The database contained multiple tables containing information about movies including actor, prices, rental duration, customers, etc. The goal was to use SQL to answer some key objective questions:

## Average rental duration of movies
## Top countries that Rockbuster customers were based in
## Sales figures between each country
